## Part 1 :
### 01. Introduction

1. Course Objectives
2. Windows Versions
3. Tools

#### Course Objectives
- Understand windows features and architecture
- Uncover internal mechanisms relevant for developers
- Enhance ability to write better software for Windows

#### Windows Versions
- Windows NT 3.1 (July 1993)
- Windows NT 3.5 (September 1994)
- Windows NT 3.51 (May 1995)

#### Tools
1. Windows built in Tools :
- Task manager, resource monitor, performance monitor, others.
- Windows built in comes with the windows and installed with it.

2. Sysinternals :
- Obtained from http://www.sysinternals.com (which is redirected to
- http://microsoft.technet.com/sysinternals)
- Most written by Mark Russinovich
- No installation needed
- Free
- Sysinternals -> A software suit that was built by Mark Russinovich and some other developers, 
Sysinternals are free to download, And no installation is needed.

3. Debugging tools for Windows
- Now part of the Windows SDK
- No installation needed
- Free
- Debugging tools for windows part of windows sdk and it follows the same pattern as Sysinternals.

## I'll try to explain below how to get tools:
- Windows 8 SDK -> https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive/
- ![Windows 8 SDK](https://github.com/A8N0RMAL/Windows-Internals/assets/119806250/61740c16-d4b7-4e2d-9551-c619372ff73a)

- Sysinternals -> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite

#### Summary
- Windows has maintained roughly the same architecture since the first Windows NT version
- Various tools will be used throughout the course to demonstrate Windows features and behaviors
